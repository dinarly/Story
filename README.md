# DINARLY Story
The DINARLY e-learning stories featuring Tasnim, Abdallah, Ai, Zhao, Sakura and Akio — the friendly dragons.

Available both as interactive DINARLY e-learning (3d or comic book modes) and also in e-book formats.

The initial courses will be focused on: Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechanics, Coding and Mathematics.

The plan is to have both interactive and pre-rendered visualisations — and also — videogames. These will be implemented using WebAssembly using the Godot and Bevy game engines. Additionally, Blender 3d will be used for pre-rendered visuals.

Once translations into other locales have been completed — they will be pinned to IPFS.

Within DINARLY all languages are treated equally by design.

If you wish to translate DINARLY into your locale please reach out to hello@drewpotter.com — especially Fus-ha Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic), Urdu and Japanese.

## Introduction
One day Abdallah and Tasnim — the friendly dragons — were digging for treasure. They had managed to find a treasure chest.

Inside the chest was an old book.

Tasnim tried to open the book, but mysteriously it was locked shut.

On the back Abdallah noticed the words “Bismillah”.

“Look!”, said Abdallah, “it says Bismillah on the back of the book.”

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Bismillah”.

As if by magic the book suddenly opened!

The book said: “Welcome to DINARLY Story. This book of knowledge has been kept safe for a future generation who will restore justice in the world”.

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Woow!”

They looked around to find that everything looked different. They were surrounded by knowledge and wisdom of previous generations. 

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Alhamdulilah!”

The book said, “choose a lesson from the Compendium to begin”.

“Our future is in your hands.”

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

One day Abdallah and Tasnim — the friendly dragons — were by the lake.

Tasnim was holding the old book, which she then opened to reveal the most beloved Compendium.

Abdallah closed his eyes and randomly chose a book from the wonderful Compendium.

As if by magic — another friendly dragon —  Ai — had appeared.

Tasnim, Abdallah and Ai then performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell down laughing from all of the silly tomfoolery.

Ai stood there, holding a notepad.

Ai told Tasnim and Abdallah: “I am writing a paper about Artificial Intelligence!”

Abdallah said: “What is Artificial Intelligence?”

Tasnim shouted: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Tasnim had a habit of visiting the library in secret and gathering useful knowledge from wonderful books.

Tasnim explained: “Inside our brains, where we think, there are special structures called neurons”.

“We can model these structures inside a computer! So a computer can think almost like we can!”

Ai smiled blissfully and nodded in agreement.

Ai also explained: “The paper I am writing is about a cute robot dog I have built!”

Tasnim looked surprised: “Robot dog?”

Abdallah and Tasnim looked in the lake to see the cute robot dog joyfully swimming around in the water.

Ai explained: “My robot dog is designed to help rescue people in an emergency!”

Abdallah and Tasnim said: “Woow! Artificial Intelligence is amazing!”

Ai said: “Would you both like to learn about Artificial Intelligence?”

Abdallah and Tasnim both nodded: “Yes please!”

Ai smiled delightfully and said: “We will begin by learning about the structures inside the brain — called neurons.”

And this is how Abdallah and Tasnim started their learning journey with Artificial Intelligence.

## Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

One day Abdallah and Tasnim – the friendly dragons – were in the forest – looking up at the night sky.

They were watching a meteor shower.

Suddenly there was a booming, thunderous, roaring sound.

The ground shook.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell to the ground and Abdallah dropped the old book.

As if by magic the book suddenly opened.

The most beloved Compendium opened up and another friendly dragon – Zhao – had appeared.

Abdallah, Tasnim and Zhao performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell down laughing from all of the silly dancing.

Zhao pointed at the crater in the forest: “This meteorite is very old. It was created at the beginning of the solar system.”

Abdallah said: “What is the solar system?”

Tasnim said: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised.

Tasnim had beautiful dreams carved into her mind – inspired by the authors of brilliant books she had read at the most beloved library.

Tasnim explained: “The solar system contains the Sun and the Earth – where we live.”

“Also other planets, moons, meteoroids, comets and asteroids.”

Zhao nodded in agreement: “I am writing a book about Quantum Mechanics.”

Abdallah looked confused.

Tasnim told Abdallah: “Do not worry Abdallah. With the right intention we can both learn about Quantum Mechanics. It will be fun!”

Zhao beamed and said: “From the large scale – the stars in space – which emit light through nuclear fusion – down to the small scale – the molecules within our own bodies…”

“Quantum Mechanics plays a role in everything around us.”

Abdallah smiled: “I want to learn about Quantum Mechanics!”

“Me too” said Tasnim.

Zhao said: “We will begin by learning about waves and wave functions”.

And this is how Abdallah and Tasnim started their learning journey with Quantum Mechanics.

## Inspirations

The following individuals have inspired this project through their incredible contributions and have therefore helped to carve the idea into my mind of what I must build and how to build it. They have my sincere thanks:

* Shigeru Miyamoto (Ocarina of Time was the reason I started writing code)
* Miguel Gomez (Interactive Simulation of Water Surfaces within Game Programming Gems helped me to build my first 3d app back in 2002)
* Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi (leader of the Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa; the chain of transmission of the letters inside The Darqawi Way — and also the wird contained within — are the most beloved of gifts)
