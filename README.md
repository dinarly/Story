# DINARLY Story
The DINARLY e-learning stories featuring Tasnim, Abdallah, Ai, Zhao, Sakura and Akio — the friendly dragons.

Available both as interactive DINARLY e-learning (3d or comic book modes) and also in e-book formats.

The initial courses will be focused on: Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechanics, Coding and Mathematics.

Join Abdallah and Tasnim – the friendly dragons – on their learning journey as they overcome many challenges. Abdallah will master these subjects and overcome his learning difficulties, whilst Tasnim will refine her existing knowledge. Both friendly dragons will become titans in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechanics, Coding and Mathematics.

The plan is to have both interactive and pre-rendered visualisations — and also — videogames. These will be implemented using WebAssembly using the Godot and Bevy game engines. Additionally, Blender 3d will be used for pre-rendered visuals.

The target hardware for DINARLY Story will include low cost videogame consoles running Linux like the Raspberry Pi 4 and the PiBoy DMG — to more powerful Windows 10 videogame consoles — such as the AYA NEO (6-core AMD Ryzen 5 4500U Mobile Processor with Radeon Graphics).

The original concept app was coded in C++ using Qt 5.14.2, but the app is now being actively rewritten in Rust. Once the Rust implementation is complete, the C++ prototype will be discarded. The C++ prototype remains for the purpose of testing.

The new components are as follows:
* The Rust app; [infatuAI-Web](https://github.com/infatuAI/infatuAI-Web) — essentially a 3d web browser licensed under the MPLv2.
* The React UI; [infatuAI-UI](https://github.com/infatuAI/infatuAI-UI) — user interface licensed under the AGPLv3.
* The clusterable orchestrator; [Sheikah](https://github.com/dinarly/Sheikah) — Elixir/Phoenix LiveView and GenServer licensed under the AGPLv3.
* The artwork; [Art](https://github.com/dinarly/Art) — animated artwork and initial rough sketches licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike.

These various components are being built or released into the open gradually.

Within DINARLY all languages are treated equally by design.

Once translations into other locales have been completed — they will be pinned to IPFS.

If you wish to translate DINARLY into your locale please reach out to hello@drewpotter.com — especially Fus-ha Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic), Urdu and Japanese.

## Introduction
One day Abdallah and Tasnim — the friendly dragons — were digging for treasure. They had managed to find a treasure chest.

Inside the chest was an old book.

Tasnim tried to open the book, but mysteriously it was locked shut.

On the back Abdallah noticed the words “Bismillah”.

“Look!”, said Abdallah, “it says Bismillah on the back of the book.”

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Bismillah”.

As if by magic the book suddenly opened!

The book said: “Welcome to DINARLY Story. This book of knowledge has been kept safe for a future generation who will restore justice in the world”.

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Woow!”

They looked around to find that everything looked different. They were surrounded by knowledge and wisdom of previous generations. 

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Alhamdulilah!”

The book said, “choose a lesson from the Compendium to begin”.

“Our future is in your hands.”

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

One day Abdallah and Tasnim — the friendly dragons — were by the lake.

Tasnim was holding the old book, which she then opened to reveal the most beloved Compendium.

Abdallah closed his eyes and randomly chose a book from the wonderful Compendium.

As if by magic — another friendly dragon —  Ai — had appeared.

Tasnim, Abdallah and Ai then performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell down laughing from all of the silly tomfoolery.

Ai stood there, holding a notepad.

Ai told Tasnim and Abdallah: “I am writing a paper about Artificial Intelligence!”

Abdallah said: “What is Artificial Intelligence?”

Tasnim shouted: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Tasnim had a habit of visiting the library in secret and gathering useful knowledge from wonderful books.

Tasnim explained: “Inside our brains, where we think, there are special structures called neurons”.

“We can model these structures inside a computer! So a computer can think almost like we can!”

Ai smiled blissfully and nodded in agreement.

Ai also explained: “The paper I am writing is about a cute robot dog I have built!”

Tasnim looked surprised: “Robot dog?”

Abdallah and Tasnim looked in the lake to see the cute robot dog joyfully swimming around in the water.

Ai explained: “My robot dog is designed to help rescue people in an emergency!”

Abdallah and Tasnim said: “Woow! Artificial Intelligence is amazing!”

Ai said: “Would you both like to learn about Artificial Intelligence?”

Abdallah and Tasnim both nodded: “Yes please!”

Ai smiled delightfully and said: “We will begin by learning about the structures inside the brain — called neurons.”

And this is how Abdallah and Tasnim started their learning journey with Artificial Intelligence.

## Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

One day Abdallah and Tasnim – the friendly dragons – were in the forest – looking up at the night sky.

They were watching a meteor shower.

Suddenly there was a booming, thunderous, roaring sound.

The ground shook.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell to the ground and Abdallah dropped the old book.

As if by magic the book suddenly opened.

The most beloved Compendium opened up and another friendly dragon – Zhao – had appeared.

Abdallah, Tasnim and Zhao performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell down laughing from all of the silly dancing.

Zhao pointed at the crater in the forest: “This meteorite is very old. It was created at the beginning of the solar system.”

Abdallah said: “What is the solar system?”

Tasnim said: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised.

Tasnim had beautiful dreams carved into her mind – inspired by the authors of brilliant books she had read at the most beloved library.

Tasnim explained: “The solar system contains the Sun and the Earth – where we live.”

“Also other planets, moons, meteoroids, comets and asteroids.”

Zhao nodded in agreement: “I am writing a book about Quantum Mechanics.”

Abdallah looked confused.

Tasnim told Abdallah: “Do not worry Abdallah. With the right intention we can both learn about Quantum Mechanics. It will be fun!”

Zhao beamed and said: “From the large scale – the stars in space – which emit light through nuclear fusion – down to the small scale – the molecules within our own bodies…”

“Quantum Mechanics plays a role in everything around us.”

Abdallah smiled: “I want to learn about Quantum Mechanics!”

“Me too!” said Tasnim.

Zhao said: “We will begin by learning about waves and wave functions”.

And this is how Abdallah and Tasnim started their learning journey with Quantum Mechanics.

## Introduction to Coding

One day Abdallah and Tasnim – the friendly dragons – were visiting the most beloved library.

They found a sad and lonely dragon lying on the floor outside.

“Look” said Tasnim, “this poor dragon is homeless.”

Abdallah gave his beaker of the finest fruit drink to the poor homeless dragon.

Tasnim handed over her lunch to this sad dragon.

The poor homeless dragon smiled and said: “Thank you both.”

As if by magic the old book suddenly opened along with the Compendium and another friendly dragon – Sakura – had appeared.

Abdallah, Tasnim, Sakura and the homeless dragon performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell down laughing from all of the silly waltzing.

Sakura said: “I am running a workshop on Coding!”

Abdallah said: “What is Coding?!”

Tasnim said: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Tasnim had a habit of learning about the latest Coding languages.

Tasnim explained: “Coding allows us to instruct a computer to perform a specific task.”

“We can compose music, make and play games or even search through libraries of information.”

Sakura nodded in agreement.

“In my workshop we will build a geospatial app to help feed the homeless dragons – using a few Coding languages – such as: Elixir, JavaScript and Python.”

“We will compose some music – using a language called Ruby.”

Abdallah looked confused: “Using a gemstone we can make music?!”

Sakura explained: “Actually Ruby is also a Coding language from Japan!”

Abdallah smiled!

“And – we will make a fun game – using a language called Rust.”

Abdallah looked baffled: “Using rust on my bike to make games?!”

Sakura explained: “Actually Rust is also a Coding language from San Francisco!”

Abdallah and Tasnim both said: “Woow! Coding is amazing!”

Sakura smiled: “Would you like to take my workshop?”

Tasnim and Abdallah grinned: “We would love to!!”

Sakura said: “We will begin by learning about a language called Python.”

And this is how Abdallah and Tasnim started their learning journey with Coding.

## Introduction to Mathematics

One day Abdallah and Tasnim – the friendly dragons – were out flying in their plane – over some remote islands in the middle of the ocean.

Tasnim was flying the plane – she had lots of experience with flying planes.

Abdallah was afraid of flying – but Tasnim had managed to convince him to fly.

Tasnim landed on the beach of a most beloved island.

“Let’s explore the island”, said Tasnim.

As if by magic the old book suddenly opened and the most wondrous Compendium appeared – alongside another friendly dragon Akio.

Abdallah, Tasnim and Akio performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell down laughing from the silly samba.

Akio told Abdallah and Tasnim: “I am writing a Mathematics crib sheet.”

Abdallah said: “What is Mathematics and what exactly is a crib sheet?”

Tasnim said: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Tasnim had developed a love and appreciation for the beauty contained within mathematical ideas and concepts.

Tasnim explained: “Mathematics is a game. It allows us to solve many problems we find in our everyday lives. We can use Mathematics to navigate, to design, to trade with and collaborate with other dragons.”

“And a crib sheet is a set of notes to help remind us of ideas and concepts.”

Akio nodded.

“On my crib sheet, we will learn about the Mathematics which you will need for the DINARLY Story courses covering Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechanics and Coding.”

“Also on this remote island, we will apply Mathematics to navigate, to find food, using only this radio and Mathematics.”

Abdallah and Tasnim said: “Woow. Mathematics is amazing!”

Abdallah said: “What is this radio?”

Tasnim explained: “This is a software-defined radio. It is a special radio which can be controlled using mathematical ideas and some Coding to behave in many different ways.”

Akio smiled in agreement: “Do you want to learn my Mathematics crib sheet?”

Abdallah and Tasnim both nodded: “Yes please!!”

And this is how Abdallah and Tasnim started their learning journey with Mathematics.

## Inspirations

The following people have inspired this project through their incredible contributions and have therefore helped to carve the idea into my mind of what I must build and how to build it. They have my sincere thanks:

* Shigeru Miyamoto (Ocarina of Time was the reason I started writing code)
* Nintendo of America (replied to my email when I was 14, when I asked them "what [did] I need to learn for making videogames?"; they guided me to learn C++/OpenGL)
* Miguel Gomez (Interactive Simulation of Water Surfaces within Game Programming Gems helped me to build my first 3d app back in 2002)
* Shaykh Abdalqadir as-Sufi (leader of the Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa; the chain of transmission of the letters inside The Darqawi Way — and also the wird contained within — are the most beloved of gifts)
