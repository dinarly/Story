# QALB Story
The QALB e-learning stories featuring Safiyyah, Abdallah, Ai, Zhao, Sakura and Akio — the friendly dragons.

Available both as interactive QALB e-learning (3d or comic book modes) and also in e-book formats.

The initial courses will be focused on: Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechanics, Coding, Mathematics, Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Semiconductors, Biophysics, Biochemistry, Shakespeare, Judo, Conservation and Arabic Language & Literature.

Join Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — on their learning journey as they overcome many challenges. Abdallah will master these subjects and overcome his learning difficulties, whilst Safiyyah will refine her existing knowledge. Both friendly dragons will become titans in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechanics, Coding, Mathematics, Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Semiconductors, Biophysics, Biochemistry, Shakespeare, Judo, Conservation and Arabic Language & Literature.

The plan is to have both interactive and pre-rendered visualisations — and also — videogames. These will be implemented using WebAssembly using the Godot and Bevy game engines. Additionally, Blender 3d will be used for pre-rendered visuals.

The target hardware for QALB Story will include low cost videogame consoles running Linux like the Raspberry Pi 4 and the PiBoy DMG — to more powerful QALB OS devices.

The original concept app is coded in C++ using Qt 5.14.2. For the future, Rust will be the focus, but at the present time the original concept app is still being used.

The new components are as follows:
* The QALB app; QALB — C++/Qt 5.14.2 app which will be released gradually in the future and licensed under the AGPLv3.
* The React UI; [qalbAI-UI](https://github.com/qalbAI/qalbAI-UI) — user interface licensed under the AGPLv3.
* The clusterable orchestrator; Sheikah — Elixir/Phoenix LiveView and GenServer licensed under the AGPLv3.
* The artwork; animated artwork and initial rough sketches licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike.

These various components are being built or released into the open gradually.

Within QALB all languages are treated equally by design.

Once translations into other locales have been completed — they will be pinned to IPFS.

## Introduction
One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were digging for treasure. They had managed to find a treasure chest.

Inside the chest was an old book.

Safiyyah tried to open the book, but mysteriously it was locked shut.

On the back Abdallah noticed the words “Bismillah”.

“Look!”, said Abdallah, “it says Bismillah on the back of the book.”

Safiyyah and Abdallah both said: “Bismillah”.

As if by magic the book suddenly opened!

The book said: “Welcome to QALB Story. This book of knowledge has been kept safe for a future generation who will restore justice in the world”.

Safiyyah and Abdallah both said: “Wow!”

They looked around to find that everything looked different. They were surrounded by knowledge and wisdom of previous generations. 

Safiyyah and Abdallah both said: “Alhamdulilah!”

The book said, “choose a lesson from the Compendium to begin”.

“Our future is in your hands.”

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were by the lake.

Safiyyah was holding the old book, which she then opened to reveal the most beloved Compendium.

Abdallah closed his eyes and randomly chose a book from the wonderful Compendium.

As if by magic — another friendly dragon — Ai — had appeared.

Safiyyah, Abdallah and Ai then performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Safiyyah fell down laughing from all of the silly tomfoolery.

Ai stood there, holding a notepad.

Ai told Safiyyah and Abdallah: “I am writing a paper about Artificial Intelligence!”

Abdallah said: “What is Artificial Intelligence?”

Safiyyah shouted: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Safiyyah had a habit of visiting the library in secret and gathering useful knowledge from wonderful books.

Safiyyah explained: “Inside our brains, where we think, there are special structures called neurons”.

“We can model these structures inside a computer! So a computer can think almost like we can!”

Ai smiled blissfully and nodded in agreement.

Ai also explained: “The paper I am writing is about a cute robot dog I have built!”

Safiyyah looked surprised: “Robot dog?”

Abdallah and Safiyyah looked in the lake to see the cute robot dog joyfully swimming around in the water.

Ai explained: “My robot dog is designed to help rescue people in an emergency!”

Abdallah and Safiyyah said: “Wow! Artificial Intelligence is amazing!”

Ai said: “Would you both like to learn about Artificial Intelligence?”

Abdallah and Safiyyah both nodded: “Yes please!”

Ai smiled delightfully and said: “We will begin by learning about the structures inside the brain — called neurons.”

And this is how Abdallah and Safiyyah started their learning journey with Artificial Intelligence.

### Neurons

Ai opened up her satchel to reveal a magical projector.

As if by magic a wonderful collection of neurons were visible.

Ai said: “Here we have the structure of some of the most delightful neurons.”

Abdallah and Safiyyah said: “Wow”

Abdallah said: “How does it work?”

At that precise moment — the cute robot dog — covered in water — came running along and shook the water all over Abdallah and Safiyyah.

Ai said: “Inside this cute robot dog —  I have modelled this structure.”

“Let me explain…”

“Between two neurons there is a gap — called a synapse.”

“A nerve impulse is sent through the neuron.”

“This is the Axon, and these are the Dendrites.”

Abdallah interrupted: “If there is a gap between the neurons — how does the signal continue across that gap?”

Safiyyah shouted: “I know!”

Abdallah looked surprised.

Safiyyah explained: “The signal causes chemicals to be released which diffuse across the synapse.”

Ai nodded in agreement: “Exactly!”

“Therefore — the signal can travel along many neurons.”

Abdallah and Safiyyah both smiled.

Ai said: “Next we will learn what happens inside the neuron.”

### Inside the neuron — inputs

Ai again opened up her satchel. This time she revealed a magical picnic hamper.

As if by magic the picnic hamper opened up — with a beautiful assortment of immaculate cupcakes and lollipops.

These cupcakes and lollipops were floating in some sort of structure.

Abdallah and Safiyyah both grinned.

Ai continued: “We have layers of neurons — each represented by delicious cupcakes.”

Abdallah and Safiyyah both said: “How does it work?”

Ai explained: “Each cupcake receives input values — these lollipops represent the synapse — or gap — between neurons — over which an input is received.”

“Together these form a neural network.”

Safiyyah and Abdallah both said: “Wow!”

Ai explained further: “The first step is the following…”

“For each input — or lollipop — we multiply the input value by a weight.”

“Then we add all of the total values for each input — or lollipop — together — to obtain a weighted sum.”

Abdallah looked confused!

Safiyyah explained: “A sum is when we add values together.”

“And a weighted sum means that we multiply each input value by something called a weight.”

Ai interrupted: “Exactly — this is how we represent the synapse between the neurons.”

Abdallah still looked confused!!

Safiyyah said: “Do not worry Abdallah — we can learn how weighted sums work — together! It will be fun!!”

Abdallah smiled: “Please may I eat a cupcake?”

Ai said: “Yes of course!”

Abdallah and Safiyyah each took a delightful cupcake.

Ai smiled: “Next, we shall learn how the weighted sum of inputs is calculated.”

## Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were in the forest — looking up at the night sky.

They were watching a meteor shower.

Suddenly there was a booming, thunderous, roaring sound.

The ground shook.

Abdallah and Safiyyah fell to the ground and Abdallah dropped the old book.

As if by magic the book suddenly opened.

The most beloved Compendium opened up and another friendly dragon — Zhao — had appeared.

Abdallah, Safiyyah and Zhao performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Safiyyah fell down laughing from all of the silly dancing.

Zhao pointed at the crater in the forest: “This meteorite is very old. It was created at the beginning of the solar system.”

Abdallah said: “What is the solar system?”

Safiyyah said: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised.

Safiyyah had beautiful dreams carved into her mind — inspired by the authors of brilliant books she had read at the most beloved library.

Safiyyah explained: “The solar system contains the Sun and the Earth — where we live.”

“Also other planets, moons, meteoroids, comets and asteroids.”

Zhao nodded in agreement: “I am writing a book about Quantum Mechanics.”

Abdallah looked confused.

Safiyyah told Abdallah: “Do not worry Abdallah. With the right intention we can both learn about Quantum Mechanics. It will be fun!”

Zhao beamed and said: “From the large scale — the stars in space — which emit light through nuclear fusion — down to the small scale — the molecules within our own bodies…”

“Quantum Mechanics plays a role in everything around us.”

Abdallah smiled: “I want to learn about Quantum Mechanics!”

“Me too!” said Safiyyah.

Zhao said: “We will begin by learning about waves and wave functions”.

And this is how Abdallah and Safiyyah started their learning journey with Quantum Mechanics.

## Introduction to Coding

One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were visiting the most beloved library.

They found a sad and lonely dragon lying on the floor outside.

“Look” said Safiyyah, “this poor dragon is homeless.”

Abdallah gave his beaker of the finest fruit drink to the poor homeless dragon.

Safiyyah handed over her lunch to this sad dragon.

The poor homeless dragon smiled and said: “Thank you both.”

As if by magic the old book suddenly opened along with the Compendium and another friendly dragon — Sakura — had appeared.

Abdallah, Safiyyah, Sakura and the homeless dragon performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Safiyyah fell down laughing from all of the silly waltzing.

Sakura said: “I am running a workshop on Coding!”

Abdallah said: “What is Coding?!”

Safiyyah said: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Safiyyah had a habit of learning about the latest Coding languages.

Safiyyah explained: “Coding allows us to instruct a computer to perform a specific task.”

“We can compose music, make and play games or even search through libraries of information.”

Sakura nodded in agreement.

“In my workshop we will build a geospatial app to help feed the homeless dragons — using a few Coding languages — such as: Elixir, JavaScript and Python.”

“We will compose some music — using a language called Ruby.”

Abdallah looked confused: “Using a gemstone we can make music?!”

Sakura explained: “Actually Ruby is also a Coding language from Japan!”

Abdallah smiled!

“And — we will make a fun game — using a language called Rust.”

Abdallah looked baffled: “Using rust on my bike to make games?!”

Sakura explained: “Actually Rust is also a Coding language from San Francisco!”

Abdallah and Safiyyah both said: “Wow! Coding is amazing!”

Sakura smiled: “Would you like to take my workshop?”

Safiyyah and Abdallah grinned: “We would love to!!”

Sakura said: “We will begin by learning about a language called Python.”

And this is how Abdallah and Safiyyah started their learning journey with Coding.

## Introduction to Mathematics

One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were out flying in their plane — over some remote islands in the middle of the ocean.

Safiyyah was flying the plane — she had lots of experience with flying planes.

Abdallah was afraid of flying — but Safiyyah had managed to convince him to fly.

Safiyyah landed on the beach of a most beloved island.

“Let’s explore the island”, said Safiyyah.

As if by magic the old book suddenly opened and the most wondrous Compendium appeared — alongside another friendly dragon Akio.

Abdallah, Safiyyah and Akio performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Safiyyah fell down laughing from the silly samba.

Akio told Abdallah and Safiyyah: “I am writing a Mathematics crib sheet.”

Abdallah said: “What is Mathematics and what exactly is a crib sheet?”

Safiyyah said: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Safiyyah had developed a love and appreciation for the beauty contained within mathematical ideas and concepts.

Safiyyah explained: “Mathematics is a game. It allows us to solve many problems we find in our everyday lives. We can use Mathematics to navigate, to design, to trade with and collaborate with other dragons.”

“And a crib sheet is a set of notes to help remind us of ideas and concepts.”

Akio nodded.

“On my crib sheet, we will learn about the Mathematics which you will need for the QALB Story courses covering Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechanics, Coding and Blockchain.”

“Also on this remote island, we will apply Mathematics to navigate, to find food, using only this radio and Mathematics.”

Abdallah and Safiyyah said: “Wow. Mathematics is amazing!”

Abdallah said: “What is this radio?”

Safiyyah explained: “This is a software-defined radio. It is a special radio which can be controlled using mathematical ideas and some Coding to behave in many different ways.”

Akio smiled in agreement: “Do you want to learn my Mathematics crib sheet?”

Abdallah and Safiyyah both nodded: “Yes please!!”

And this is how Abdallah and Safiyyah started their learning journey with Mathematics.

## Introduction to Blockchain

One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were in the marketplace.

The prices of all of the goods had gone up!

As if by magic the book suddenly opened.

The most beloved Compendium opened up and another friendly dragon — Sakura — had appeared.

Abdallah, Safiyyah and Sakura performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Safiyyah fell down laughing from all of the silly whirling.

Sakura said: “I am running a workshop on Blockchain — and — how to attach gold and silver coins to a blockchain.”

Abdallah said: “What is a blockchain?”

Safiyyah said: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Safiyyah had a habit of building a portfolio of blockchain assets.

Safiyyah explained: “When a central bank prints money it devalues the currency and therefore reduces our purchasing power. This means we can buy less goods with the same amount of money.”

“However — Blockchain is based on a rigorous cryptographic algorithm based on sound mathematics.”

“Blockchain is an alternative monetary system, where you cannot simply print endless units of currency.”

Sakura nodded and Abdallah looked confused!

Safiyyah explained: “Cryptography is a branch of Mathematics which is very important and vital in our everyday lives.”

Abdallah still looked confused!

Safiyyah said: “Do not worry Abdallah. With the right intention we can both learn about Blockchain. It will be fun!”

Abdallah smiled!

Sakura smiled blissfully: “Blockchain is a mathematically rigorous and beautiful way to represent money, which has other important uses too!”

Abdallah said: “I want to learn about Blockchain!”

“Me too” said Safiyyah.

Sakura said: “We will begin by learning how Blockchain works.”

And this is how Abdallah and Safiyyah started their learning journey with Blockchain.

## Introduction to Cybersecurity

One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were at the gym. They were doing an intense abs workout.

After the workout Abdallah and Safiyyah both picked up their games consoles.

They started playing a game.

A message appeared on Abdallah’s game.

The message stated: “You have been hacked! You must download an app. Otherwise you will lose your saved games!”

Abdallah said: “Oh no!”

As if by magic the old book opened along with the delightful Compendium — and — another friendly dragon — Ai — had appeared.

Safiyyah, Abdallah and Ai then performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Safiyyah fell down laughing from the dreamy shimmying.

Ai said: “I am starting an annual Cybersecurity conference.”

Abdallah said: “What is Cybersecurity?”

Safiyyah said: “I know.”

Abdallah looked surprised. Safiyyah had attended many Cybersecurity conferences and delivered talks on defending against cyber attacks.

Safiyyah explained: “Cybersecurity is protecting devices from damage, disruption or theft of data.”

Abdallah looked confused!

Safiyyah explained: “The message on your game is a scam! A bad dragon is trying to hack your console.”

“What should I do?!” said Abdallah.

Ai said: “Do not worry Abdallah — I will teach you both about Cybersecurity — and — how to defend yourselves from cyber attacks.”

Abdallah and Safiyyah shouted: “Wow! Cybersecurity is awesome! Please teach us!”

Ai said: “We will begin by learning about packets of data.”

And this is how Abdallah and Safiyyah started their learning journey with Cybersecurity.

## Introduction to Semiconductors

One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were in the mountains.

They had noticed that the signal for the internet was not working!

As if by magic the old book opened along with the wonderful Compendium — and — another friendly dragon — Zhao — had appeared.

Safiyyah, Abdallah and Zhao then performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Safiyyah fell down laughing from the delightful jiving.

Zhao said: “I am designing a clustered computer — which keeps working in the mountains — by using a special technology called IPFS — and — using my own custom semiconductor chips.”

Abdallah said: “What is a clustered computer? And what is IPFS? And what exactly is a semiconductor chip?”

Safiyyah said: “I know.”

Abdallah looked surprised. Safiyyah was an expert on computer technology.

Safiyyah explained: “A computer cluster is a group of many computers which work together to perform tasks as one computer.”

“IPFS is the InterPlanetary File System — a distributed file system — which even works in the mountains or remote areas — even without a good internet connection!”

“And semiconductor chips are like the brains of electronic devices, such as: games consoles, televisions and phones.”

Abdallah smiled and Zhao nodded in agreement.

Zhao explained: “The design of my computer is eco-friendly and modular so that it is easy to repair!”

“I am building this computer so that all dragons around the world can access learning resources regardless of whether they have a good internet connection or not! Semiconductors are vital to achieve this goal!”

Abdallah and Safiyyah said: “Wow! Semiconductors are fabulous!”

Zhao grinned: “Would you like to learn about semiconductors?”

Abdallah and Safiyyah screamed: “We would love to!”

Zhao explained: “We will begin by learning how semiconductors work.”

And this is how Abdallah and Safiyyah started their learning journey with Semiconductors.
