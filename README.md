## Introduction
One day Abdallah and Tasnim — the friendly dragons — were digging for treasure. They had managed to find a treasure chest.

Inside the chest was an old book.

Tasnim tried to open the book, but mysteriously it was locked shut.

On the back Abdallah noticed the words “Bismillah”.

“Look!”, said Abdallah, “it says Bismillah on the back of the book.”

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Bismillah”.

As if by magic the book suddenly opened!

The book said “Welcome to DINARLY Story. This book of knowledge has been kept safe for a future generation who will restore justice in the world”.

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Woow!”

They looked around to find that everything looked different. They were surrounded by knowledge and wisdom of previous generations. 

Tasnim and Abdallah both said: “Alhamdulilah!”

The book said, “choose a lesson from the Compendium to begin”.

“Our future is in your hands.”

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

One day Abdallah and Tasnim — the friendly dragons — were by the lake.

Tasnim was holding the old book, which she then opened to reveal the most beloved Compendium.

Abdallah closed his eyes and randomly chose a book from the wonderful Compendium.

As if by magic — another friendly dragon —  Ai — had appeared.

Tasnim, Abdallah and Ai then performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell down laughing from all of the silly tomfoolery.

Ai stood there, holding a notepad.

Ai told Tasnim and Abdallah: “I am writing a paper about Artificial Intelligence!”

Abdallah said: “What is Artificial Intelligence?”

Tasnim shouted: “I know!!”

Abdallah looked surprised. Tasnim had a habit of visiting the library in secret and gathering useful knowledge from wonderful books.

Tasnim explained: “Inside our brains, where we think, there are special structures called neurons”.

“We can model these structures inside a computer! So a computer can think almost like we can!”

Ai smiled blissfully and nodded in agreement.

Ai also explained: “The paper I am writing is about a cute robot dog I have built!”

Tasnim looked surprised: “Robot dog?”

Abdallah and Tasnim looked in the lake to see the cute robot dog joyfully swimming around in the water.

Ai explained: “My robot dog is designed to help rescue people in an emergency!”

Abdallah and Tasnim said “Woow! Artificial Intelligence is amazing!”

Ai said: “Would you both like to learn about Artificial Intelligence?”

Abdallah and Tasnim both nodded: “Yes please!”

Ai smiled delightfully and said: “We will begin by learning about the structures inside the brain — called neurons.”

And this is how Abdallah and Tasnim started their learning journey with Artificial Intelligence.
