Safiyyah and Abdallah had finished joyfully eating their delicious cupcakes.

The cute robot dog was taking a nap.

At this precise moment Ai said: “Now — before we can perform any calculations inside our neurons — we must first transform the input values.”

Abdallah said: “How do we transform them?”

Safiyyah said: “I know!”

Abdallah looked perplexed.

Safiyyah explained: “We have to make sure the input values have a similar size or magnitude.”

Ai said: “Exactly!!”

Abdallah said: “Why?!”

Safiyyah interrupted: “It is easier for the neural network to process the incoming values if they have a similar sort of value.”

Ai nodded in agreement: “We must normalise or standardise the input values.”

Abdallah smiled!

Ai continued: “We will learn how to do this as we progress on our learning journey.”

“For now — you also need to know that the input values are independent variables.”

Safiyyah interrupted: “Independent variables — meaning that their variation does not depend on other variables?”

Ai said: “Exactly!”

Abdallah looked confused: “So you mean to say — that the variation of the input values — does not depend on other input values?”

Ai beamed: “Yes! Exactly!!”

The cute robot dog woke up from having a dreamy power nap.

Safiyyah and Abdallah both smiled.

Ai said: “Next we will perform an actual example calculation on the input values — by calculating the weighted sum for a most beloved neuron.”
