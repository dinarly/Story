Ai opened up her satchel to reveal a magical projector.

As if by magic a wonderful collection of neurons were visible.

Ai said: “Here we have the structure of some of the most delightful neurons.”

Abdallah and Safiyyah said: “Wow”

Abdallah said: “How does it work?”

At that precise moment — the cute robot dog — covered in water — came running along and shook the water all over Abdallah and Safiyyah.

Ai said: “Inside this cute robot dog —  I have modelled this structure.”

“Let me explain…”

“Between two neurons there is a gap — called a synapse.”

“A nerve impulse is sent through the neuron.”

“This is the Axon, and these are the Dendrites.”

Abdallah interrupted: “If there is a gap between the neurons — how does the signal continue across that gap?”

Safiyyah shouted: “I know!”

Abdallah looked surprised.

Safiyyah explained: “The signal causes chemicals to be released which diffuse across the synapse.”

Ai nodded in agreement: “Exactly!”

“Therefore — the signal can travel along many neurons.”

Abdallah and Safiyyah both smiled.

“Next we will learn what happens inside the neuron.”
