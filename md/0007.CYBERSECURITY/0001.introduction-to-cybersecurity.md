One day Abdallah and Tasnim — the friendly dragons — were at the gym. They were doing an intense abs workout.

After the workout Abdallah and Tasnim both picked up their games consoles.

They started playing a game.

A message appeared on Abdallah’s game.

The message stated: “You have been hacked! You must download an app. Otherwise you will lose your saved games!”

Abdallah said: “Oh no!”

As if by magic the old book opened along with the delightful Compendium — and — another friendly dragon — Ai — had appeared.

Tasnim, Abdallah and Ai then performed the traditional cute friendly dragon greeting.

This greeting is a dance with lots of giggling and laughter.

Abdallah and Tasnim fell down laughing from the dreamy shimmying.

Ai said: “I am starting an annual Cybersecurity conference.”

Abdallah said: “What is Cybersecurity?”

Tasnim said: “I know.”

Abdallah looked surprised. Tasnim had attended many Cybersecurity conferences and delivered talks on defending against cyber attacks.

Tasnim explained: “Cybersecurity is protecting devices from damage, disruption or theft of data.”

Abdallah looked confused!

Tasnim explained: “The message on your game is a scam! A bad dragon is trying to hack your console.”

“What should I do?!” said Abdallah.

Ai said: “Do not worry Abdallah — I will teach you both about Cybersecurity — and — how to defend yourselves from cyber attacks.”

Abdallah and Tasnim shouted: “Woow! Cybersecurity is awesome! Please teach us!”

Ai said: “We will begin by learning about packets of data.”

And this is how Abdallah and Tasnim started their learning journey with Cybersecurity.
