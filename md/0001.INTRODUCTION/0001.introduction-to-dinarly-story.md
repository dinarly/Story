One day Abdallah and Safiyyah — the friendly dragons — were digging for treasure. They had managed to find a treasure chest.

Inside the chest was an old book.

Safiyyah tried to open the book, but mysteriously it was locked shut.

On the back Abdallah noticed the words “Bismillah”.

“Look!”, said Abdallah, “it says Bismillah on the back of the book.”

Safiyyah and Abdallah both said: “Bismillah”.

As if by magic the book suddenly opened!

The book said: “Welcome to QALB Story. This book of knowledge has been kept safe for a future generation who will restore justice in the world”.

Safiyyah and Abdallah both said: “Wow!”

They looked around to find that everything looked different. They were surrounded by knowledge and wisdom of previous generations. 

Safiyyah and Abdallah both said: “Alhamdulilah!”

The book said, “choose a lesson from the Compendium to begin”.

“Our future is in your hands.”
